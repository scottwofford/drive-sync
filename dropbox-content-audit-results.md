**Created:** 2026-02-18
**Source:** Full hydration + AI-assisted deep read of 42 priority .docx files from Dropbox
**Purpose:** Identify and sequence content for scottwofford.com and scwoff.substack.com
**Converted .txt copies:** `/tmp/docx_reads/` (organized by category)

---

## Publishing Strategy: Recommended Sequence

Given your Substack (scwoff.substack.com) and scottwofford.com, here's a suggested publishing sequence. The logic: **lead with your strongest, most distinctive voice** to establish what kind of writer you are, then build out a library.

### Phase 1: Establish Your Voice (Weeks 1-3)

| # | Piece | Platform | Why now | Effort |
|---|-------|----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | **"Learnings from being robbed in rural Peru"** (Fulbright Personal Statement) | Substack post + scottwofford.com /writing | Your strongest narrative. Vivid, immediate, establishes you as someone who's lived an interesting life. Sets the tone for everything after. | ~2 hrs |
| 2 | **"How My 10-Year Vision Has Changed Every Year since 2010"** (Vision 2010-2026 compiled) | Substack post + scottwofford.com /writing | Unique format -- raw vision documents with present-day commentary. The arc from "communications consultant" to "AI safety nonprofit co-founder" is genuinely compelling. No one else can write this. | ~3-4 hrs |
| 3 | **"My Senior Year Spring (aka I'm feelin' 22)"** (Reflections after Austin) | Substack post | Pure energy. Captures a universal moment (everything clicking at 22). Quick edit -- mostly converting bullets to prose. Pairs well after the Vision piece as "here's where it all started." | ~1.5 hrs |

### Phase 2: Build Depth (Weeks 4-6)

| # | Piece | Platform | Why now | Effort |
|---|-------|----------|---------|--------|
| 4 | **"Why I Stayed in Mexico City"** (Cordes Fellowship) | Substack post | The "Fulbright scholar who unexpectedly stays" story. Specific numbers give credibility. Connects Peru story (#1) to the Mexico chapter of your life. | ~2-3 hrs |
| 5 | **"An Essay I Wrote at 17 About My Dad"** (Common App) | Substack post | Warm, personal, different tone. The three-generation portrait is charming. Frame as throwback with brief present-day reflection. Good Father's Day timing if you align it. | ~1 hr |
| 6 | **"That Time I Ended Up Naked on the front page of a Mexican Newspaper"** (Naked Newspaper) | Substack post | Funny, light, shareable. Needs the most creative expansion (only 7 lines source material) but the hook is irresistible. Palette cleanser between heavier pieces. | ~3-4 hrs |

### Phase 3: Go Deeper (Weeks 7-10)

| # | Piece | Platform | Why now | Effort |
|---|-------|----------|---------|--------|
| 7 | **"Learning to Break Up at 21"** (Arg Journal) | Substack post | Strongest narrative arc but needs heavy anonymization. The five-month chronicle of deciding to end a relationship abroad is universally relatable. Worth the editing investment. | ~5-6 hrs |
| 8 | **"The Airport Miracle"** (Airport Adventure to Dallas) | Substack post | Fun, cinematic travel disaster. Can weave in the "should I stay or go" career question. | ~2 hrs |
| 9 | **"Elon Musk and the EA Community"** (Elon Musk & EA) | Substack post + scottwofford.com | Most topical. Needs your personal voice from inside AI safety added. Without it, it's generic; with it, it's distinctive. | ~4-5 hrs |
| 10 | **"Reality Check or Death of My Dreams"** (Big Decisions) | Substack post | Mentor Walter giving hard truths about career dreams. Needs significant expansion but the emotional core is strong. | ~3-4 hrs |

### Website Integration

- **scottwofford.com/writing**: Create a "Writing" page that links to Substack posts + hosts any pieces you want as standalone pages
- **Substack**: Primary publishing platform. RSS already feeds into scottwofford.com/blog
- **Cross-post candidates**: Peru (#1), Vision evolution (#2), and Elon/EA (#9) could also go on LessWrong or EA Forum given your AI safety context

### Total Effort Estimate

| Phase | Pieces | Total Editing Time | Scott Input Needed |
|-------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Phase 1 | 3 pieces | ~7 hrs | ~1 hr (review/approve each draft, add present-day commentary for Vision piece) |
| Phase 2 | 3 pieces | ~6-8 hrs | ~1 hr (review/approve, write Naked Newspaper expansion notes) |
| Phase 3 | 4 pieces | ~14-17 hrs | ~2-3 hrs (anonymization decisions for Arg Journal, personal voice for EA piece) |
| **Total** | **10 pieces** | **~27-32 hrs** | **~4-5 hrs from Scott** |

Most editing can be Claude-assisted (converting bullets to prose, stripping application framing, anonymizing names). Scott's time is mainly for: (1) approving tone/voice, (2) adding present-day reflections, (3) privacy decisions on what to anonymize vs. cut.

## Tier 1: HIGH — Ready with Moderate Editing

### 1. Fulbright Personal Statement
- **Rating:** HIGH
- **Effort:** ~2 hours editing
- **Suggested title:** "The Night I Got Robbed in Peru"
- **Dropbox source:** `9 Archives UT Misc/15 Fulbright/Application/Personal atement/Drafts/Scott's Personal Statement.docx`
- **Converted copy:** `/tmp/docx_reads/fulbright/Scott's Personal Statement.txt`
- **Summary:** Opens with a vivid scene of being robbed at knifepoint in Jaen, Peru during a backpacking trip, then being taken in by a local woman. Pivots to reflecting on suburban upbringing and hunger for cultural immersion.
- **Standout quote:** "The middle-aged woman who had seen the robbery invited me into her home and I gladly accepted. Although her home was only one room crowded with family, it was a huge relief to sit down and compose myself."
- **Editing needed:**
  - Strip Fulbright application framing ("ideal candidate for a Fulbright Grant")
  - Let the Peru robbery story breathe more (currently compressed)
  - Cut generic closing paragraph about "global business leader"
  - Add brief present-day reflection

### 2. "Reflections after Austin" (Senior Spring Journal)
- **Rating:** HIGH
- **Effort:** ~1.5 hours editing
- **Suggested title:** "Senior Spring" or "If We Left Scott at the Gas Station"
- **Dropbox source:** `6 personal notes/To me from me (Scott)/2010/9 Reflections after Austin.docx`
- **Converted copy:** `/tmp/docx_reads/journals/9 Reflections after Austin.txt`
- **Summary:** Scott returns from spring break in Austin during senior year. Thesis work, new friendships, a successful DC trip, being single, plans for going abroad. Genuinely optimistic energy.
- **Standout quote:** "'If we left Scott at the gas station, he would have found a job within 15 minutes.'" AND "I can't believe I haven't traveled by myself more -- I love it."
- **Editing needed:**
  - Convert bullet-point format into prose paragraphs
  - Remove the hookup boast and Whitney stomach-sick detail
  - Core narrative is strong as-is: "I'm 22, everything is clicking, the world is wide open"

### 3. Cordes Fellowship Application (Why I Stayed in Mexico)
- **Rating:** HIGH
- **Effort:** ~2-3 hours editing
- **Suggested title:** "Why I Stayed in Mexico City"
- **Dropbox source:** `3 GoGetEm/Opp-Collab_Imp-Inv/Opp Collab/Wofford_2013 Cordes Fellowship Application.docx`
- **Converted copy:** `/tmp/docx_reads/gogetem/Wofford_2013 Cordes Fellowship Application.txt`
- **Summary:** Scott's work leading GIIMAP after his Fulbright. How he stayed in Mexico, was inspired by Ashoka Fellows, raised $30K from 17 Mexican organizations, and mapped 83 social enterprises and 338 impact investing organizations.
- **Standout quote:** "When I moved to Mexico as a Fulbright Scholar, I had no idea I would stay in Mexico after my Fulbright was finished. The air pollution, traffic congestion, police corruption and drug violence make Mexico City a challenging place to live. But, after seeing some tenacious Ashoka Fellows tackling gargantuan social problems, I could not turn down the challenge."
- **Editing needed:**
  - Strip application form scaffolding
  - Expand the "why I stayed" story (currently too compressed)
  - Add present-day reflection connecting to current AI safety work

---

## Tier 1.5: HIGH (as compiled series)

### 4. Vision Documents (2010-2016 Evolution)
- **Rating:** HIGH as compiled series
- **Effort:** ~3-4 hours (compiling + writing commentary)
- **Suggested title:** "How My 10-Year Vision Changed Every Year (2010-2016)"
- **Dropbox sources:**
  - `7 Books Lectures Lists/Book Notes/Life Entrepreneurs/Life Entrepreneurs Vision.docx`
  - `7 Books Lectures Lists/Book Notes/Life Entrepreneurs/Vision 2012.docx`
  - `7 Books Lectures Lists/Book Notes/Life Entrepreneurs/Vision 2013.docx`
  - `7 Books Lectures Lists/Book Notes/Life Entrepreneurs/Vision 2015.docx`
  - `7 Books Lectures Lists/Book Notes/Life Entrepreneurs/Vision 2016.docx`
- **Converted copies:** `/tmp/docx_reads/vision/` (all 5 files)
- **Summary:** Tracks the evolution of Scott's "10-year vision" across 6 years:
  - **~2010:** Communications consultant, international travel, Board of Advisors
  - **2012:** "Pioneer advancing impact investing and social business"
  - **2013:** "Social entrepreneur and thought-leader," co-founder of a social enterprise
  - **2015:** **THE PIVOT** -- "Accomplished leader at a leading technology company" in Bogota
  - **2016:** AI, big data, behavioral economics, agile product development, Seattle/SF/NYC
- **Why it works:** The arc from "communications consultant" to "tech leader mentioning AI" is genuinely compelling given you ended up co-founding an AI safety nonprofit. The 2013-to-2015 pivot from social entrepreneur to corporate tech is the most honest and interesting moment.
- **Editing needed:**
  - Compile all 5 visions into one document with year headers
  - Write brief present-day commentary for each version (what changed, why, what you see now)
  - Add a 2026 postscript: where you actually ended up vs. where you planned
  - The raw visions ARE the content -- the editorial frame is what makes it publishable

---

## Tier 2: MEDIUM-HIGH — Strong Material, More Work Needed

### 5. "Arg Journal" (Argentina Breakup Chronicle)
- **Rating:** MEDIUM-HIGH (with heavy editing)
- **Effort:** ~5-6 hours editing
- **Suggesd title:** "Learning to Break Up at 21"
- **Dropbox source:** `6 personal notes/To me from me (Scott)/2010/Arg Journal.docx`
- **Converted copy:** `/tmp/docx_reads/journals/Arg Journal.txt`
- **Summary:** The longest and most emotionally intense entry. Documents the entire arc of deciding to break up with college girlfriend Whitney during a semester abroad in Argentina and backpacking through Peru/Ecuador. Covers relationship conflict, infidelity guilt, a stolen backpack in Peru, talks with mom, and ultimately the breakup decision.
- **Standout quote:** "The secret to love is to be happy that you found someone that loves you back." AND "Don't be afraid Scott, the benefits of being courageous will far outweigh the temporary insecurity you feel."
- **Editing needed:**
  - **MAJOR anonymization** -- Whitney and other named people need pseudonyms or removal (this is someone else's story too)
  - Cut infidelity planning sections (the literal pros/cons of deny vs. make up a story)
  - Cut problematic language
  - Distill from ~5,000 words to ~1,500-word focused essay
  - The emotional core -- fear of loneliness vs. knowing something isn't right -- is universally relatable

---

## Tier 2: MEDIUM — Good Hooks, Significant Work

### 6. "Airport Adventure to Dallas"
- **Rating:** MEDIUM
- **Effort:** ~2 hours editing
- **Suggested title:** "The Airport Miracle" or "How I Bribed My Way Onto a Plane"
- **Dropbox source:** `6 personal notes/To me from me (Scott)/2012/70 Airport Adventure to Dallas.docx`
- **Converted copy:** `/tmp/docx_reads/journals/70 Airport Adventure to Dallas.txt`
- **Summary:** Scott nearly misses his flight from Mexico in a chaotic series of events -- late taxi, missed flight, sneaking past security, talking his way onto a plane. Then pivots to weighing whether to stay in Latin America or return to the US.
- **Standout quote:** "After a crazy late taxi ride to the airport, missing my flight, an attempted [bribe] of an immigration official, sneaking past security, convincing a flight attendant th my un-stamped tourist card was no big deal, and almost having to de-board the plane due to weight restrictions -- I'm on the plane to Dallas!"
- **Editing needed:**
  - Expand the airport sequence into a full narrative (currently just one paragraph)
  - Either cut the career-planning section or weave it into a "should I stay or go" narrative
  - Fix the incomplete word ("attempted [bribe]")

### 7. Common App -- Dad's Influence
- **Rating:** MEDIUM
- **Effort:** ~1 hour editing
- **Suggested title:** "An Essay I Wrote at 17 About My Dad"
- **Dropbox source:** `9 Archives UT Misc/0 College Applications/Common App. Dad's influence.doc`
- **Converted copy:** `/tmp/docx_reads/college_apps/Common App. Dad's influence.txt`
- **Summary:** College application essay about Richard Wofford's influence. Three-generation portrait: grandfather Jesse the surgeon, Richard the entrepreneur (Front Porch Development), Scott the kid distributing lawn care flyers in 8th grade.
- **Standout quote:** "In 8th grade, because of my dad's encouragement, I boldly distributed flyers promoting my new lawn-care service."
- **Editing needed:**
  - Light polish
  - Write a brief present-day framing intro (what you see differently now)
  - The dinner-table-lectures detail is specific and memorable -- keep it

### 8. "Naked Newspaper"
- **Rating:** MEDIUM
- **Effort:** ~3-4 hours (mostly expansion)
- **Suggested title:** "That Time I Ended Up Naked in a Mexican Newspaper"
- **Dropbox source:** `6 personal notes/To me from me (Scott)/2013/8 Naked Newspaper.docx`
- **Converted copy:** `/tmp/docx_reads/journals/8 Naked Newspaper.txt`
- **Summary:** Naked pictures of Scott and friends were published in a Mexican newspaper's online edition. He worries about professional consequences.
- **Standout quote:** "I don't care about people seeing me naked, but I don't want it to affect my professional."
- **Editing needed:**
  - **Major expansion needed** -- only 7 lines currently
  - Needs context: how did this happen? What was the aftermath?
  - The hook is irresistible -- the sentence is also unfinished ("affect my professional" what?)
  - Could be a tight, funny 500-800 word essay

### 9. "Big Decisions"
- **Rating:** MEDIUM
- **Effort:** ~3-4 hours editing
- **Suggested title:** "Reality Check or Death of My Dreams"
- **Dropbox source:** `6 personal notes/To me from me (Scott)/2011/35 Big Decisions.docx`
- **Converted copy:** `/tmp/docx_reads/journals/35 Big Decisions.txt`
- **Summary:** Scott's birthday week in DC/Colombia. Weighs a Ketchum PR firm offer against going to South America. Has a reality-check conversation with mentor Walter.
- **Standout quote:** "Big talk with Walter. It was either a reality check or the death of my dreams."
- **Editing needed:**
  - Significant expansion (currently too telegraphic)
  - The career-crossroads theme has broad appeal
  - Remove specific names or get permission
  - Build out the Walter conversation -- that's the heart of the piece

### 10. Elon Musk & EA/Rationality
- **Rating:** MEDIUM
- **Effort:** ~4-5 hours editing
- **Suggested title:** "Elon Musk and the Effective Altruism Community: A View from Inside AI Safety"
- **Dropbox source:** `3 GoGetEm/3 Effective_Altruism/Elon Musk & EA:Rationality.docx`
- **Converted copy:** `/tmp/docx_reads/gogetem/Elon Musk & EA:Rationality.txt`
- **Summary:** Detailed analysis of Musk's relationship with EA/Rationalist communities, structured as "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly." Well-sourced but reads like a research report.
- **Standout quote:** "Effective altruism stresses rational allocation of resources to maximize good, whereas Musk's Dogecoin antics encouraged speculative frenzy over a joke asset."
- **Editing needed:**
  - **Add personal voice** -- "As someone working in AI safety..." (currently zero personal perspective)
  - Tighter editing (quite long and repetitive)
  - Clear thesis beyond "it's complicated"
  - With your perspective from inside the AI safety world, this becomes distinctive

## Cross-Cutting Themes

Themes that recur across the publishable pieces -- useful for creating a cohesive Substack identity:

1. **Restlessness vs. settling down** -- Almost every piece touches this tension
2. **Living abroad as a young American** -- Peru, Argentina, Mexico, Colombia
3. **Career pivots and reinvention** -- Social entrepreneur to tech to AI safety
4. **The pull between adventure and security** -- Choosing Mexico City over DC, choosing Amazon over social enterprise
5. **Self-improvement and vision-setting** -- The "Life Entrepreneurs" framework, positive psychology influence

These themes naturally connect to your current story (AI safety, learning to code at 37, building Luthien) -- consider weaving present-day reflections into each piece to create a through-line.

## Unmined Dropbox Content (Not Yet Converted/Read)

The "To me from me" series has **~100 journal entries** spanning 2008-2015 -- we only deep-read 15 of the most promising. Notable unconverted entries worth checking:

| File | Year | Why interesting |
|------|------|----------------|
| `Amazon Finance Offer Debate.docx` | 2014 | Career decision that led to 7 years at Amazon |
| `Black November.docx` | 2014 | Title suggests emotional depth |
| `Missed Flight in Istanbul.docx` | 2015 | Travel disaster (like Airport Adventure) |
| `Seattle Job Trek Takeaways.docx` | 2014 | What drew you to Seattle/Amazon |
| `things i will miss about college.docx` | undated | Nostalgia piece, could pair with Reflections after Austin |
| `Post Colombia Xmas 2015-2016.docx` | 2015 | Later-life reflection |
| `SQL Overwhelmed.docx` | 2015 | Early Amazon technical struggle -- connects to current coding journey |

Also: the `9.2 College Portfolio/11 Blog/` folder contains old blog drafts (Colombia, Mapeo II, Father's Day) that were never assessed.
