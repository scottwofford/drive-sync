# Current Objective: LinkedIn Optimization (Drive Sync Complete)

## Status: Drive sync done. LinkedIn work remaining.

## What's Done

### Google Drive Sync Infrastructure — COMPLETE
- [x] Open-source config-driven script → `scottwofford/drive-sync` (public repo)
- [x] luthien-org sync working (launchd every 4 hrs)
- [x] Personal Drive sync working (3.9 GB synced, launchd every 4 hrs)
- [x] All resilience fixes: error handling, macOS notifications, rclone auth check, stranded commit recovery
- [x] COE filed in `drive-sync/coes/`
- [x] luthien-org PR #1 closed (fixes shipped via shared script)
- [x] Parsing bug fixed (log output to stderr)

### GitHub Profile Cleanup — PARTIAL
- [x] Archived 7 bootcamp repos (2014-2015)
- [x] Created `private-claude-code-docs` (private) for sensitive working docs
- [x] Moved LinkedIn research CSV/XLS from public personal-site to private repo
- [ ] Pin best repos (personal-site, scottys-llm-jedi-council, luthien-proxy)
- [ ] Update GitHub bio to match new LinkedIn headline

### CLAUDE.md Updates — COMPLETE
- [x] Added "effort scoping" preference (always include input needed from Scott)
- [x] Scott added "don't outsource verification" preference

## What's Remaining — LinkedIn

### 1. LinkedIn Founder Profile Optimization
**Headline:** DONE — "Helping Claude Code follow your rules @ Luthien | Ex-Amazon"

**Still to do:**
- [ ] Write About section (founder pitch style, not resume)
- [ ] Rewrite Experience section (Luthien description, Amazon bullets, trim skills lists)
- [ ] Feature scottwofford.com in Featured section
- [ ] Remove/trim certifications (show doing, not learning)
- [ ] Update GitHub bio to match new headline

**Research lives in:** `private-claude-code-docs/founder_linkedin_profiles_research.csv`
**Session log:** `luthien-private-session-logs/2026-02-07_linkedin-founder-optimization.csv`

**Key models to reference:**
- Daniela Amodei — non-technical co-founder in AI safety (closest parallel)
- Cristina Cordova — BD/partnerships → exec/operator arc
- Claire Vo — non-technical origin → technical builder arc
